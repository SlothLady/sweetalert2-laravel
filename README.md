## FAQ

### 1. What's the difference with [realrashid/sweet-alert](https://github.com/realrashid/sweet-alert) package?

The `realrashid/sweet-alert` package is too opinionated and too complex: facade, midddleware, adding vendor files to apps, whatnot ðŸ¤¯. And all that with 0 tests.

This package is simple, straightforward, and unopinionated. It's API is aimed to be as close as possible to the original [sweetalert2](https://sweetalert2.github.io/#configuration).

It simply provides a way to use SweetAlert2 in your Laravel application without touching JS or CSS files.

### 2. How it works?

Simple and straightforward:

- The `Swal::fire()` method will pass the options to the [flashed session](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/session#flash-data).
- The blade partial template will check if there are any flashed session data and will render the SweetAlert2.

### 3. Any limitations?

SweetAlert2 is a JavaScript package and some of its options are JS callbacks. It's not possible to use them in the `Swal::fire()` method.
If you need to use JS callbacks, you have to go to JS and use the SweetAlert2 API directly.

### 4. Can I use SweetAlert2 without this package?

Yes, you can use SweetAlert2 without this package. Just `npm install sweetalert2` and use the SweetAlert2 API directly in your JS files.
